Registering a new user account is easy. If you visit the site
[https://registry.ioos.us/](https://registry.ioos.us/), there will be a link on
the top navigation bar labeled __REGISTER__. 

To register an account enter the following pieces of information:

- **Email**: Your electronic mail address. This should be an email address used in
  a professional context, preferrably not your personal gmail account.
- **Full Name**: Your full name, (First Last) so that we can identify the person
  whom the account belongs to.
- **Organization**: The organization which the account should represent or belong
  to. This is a dropdown menu with the list of available organizations that
  currently contribute as a regional association or national partner.

  If an organization is not listed, you can select "Other" and we'll reach out
  to you and likely add the organization for you.

- **Password** and **Password Confirm**: Enter a password of at least 8 characters. The
  password can contain any length, and any characters.

After the information is entered, click the _Submit_ button at the bottom of
the form. Once the information is submitted, an email will be sent to the email
address you entered confirming that the address belongs to you. Another email
will be sent to the site administrator, letting him know that a user has
requested a new account.

We do not automatically accept accounts. Since user accounts have permissions
to upload content to the IOOS catalog we review each user request to ensure
that the user represents the interests of IOOS, a regional association or a
national partner. The administrator will then mark the account as _Approved_. 

After the account has been marked as _Approved_ you will receive an email
letting you know that your account has been approved. You may now log in and
use the site using the credentials you entered in the form.


To summarize the steps again:

1. Visit [https://registry.ioos.us/users/new](https://registry.ioos.us/users/new)
2. Enter your account information.
3. Check your email and click the verify link in the email from the site.
4. Wait for approval from an administrator, which should come in the form of an email.
5. Log in and begin using the site.

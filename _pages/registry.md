The Harvest Registry is the access point for adding or updating content in the
IOOS Catalog.  The Registry maintains a list of web-accessible folders (WAFs) and
CS-W services from which the Catalog will harvest ISO 19115-2 compatible XML metadata
records.

The first step to using the Registry is to request an account, details on that can be
found on the [user accounts]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/registry/users) page.  Once
your account is approved and your IOOS organization affiliation confirmed, the next step is to configure
the list of WAF and/or CS-W harvest sources that contain metadata describing your organization's
datasets.  Detail on how to do this can be found on the [managing harvests]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/registry/harvests)
page.

The Registry provides a high degree of control over managing, troubleshooting (including displaying
ISO XML validation and CKAN harvesting errors), and previewing dataset metadata for publishing in the
[IOOS Catalog](https://data.ioos.us/).
